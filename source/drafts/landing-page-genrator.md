soving the problem twice

I build [a lot of](https://t9t.io) different products. Each product needs a landing page. And I want to generate a landing page in 1 minute. There are many landing page generator site, but no one suites my need. They all need to drag elements, and do some design, I want to build a tool with some componenets ready, when I want to create a new landing page. I just need to 把这些 components 搭起来


What I want

- Beautiful
- No coding
- No design
- Easy to modify

- backend: serverless; node.js; dynamodb; mongodb; postgres; sqlite; mysql; docker; rabbitmq; Redis; express; GraphQL


hourly rate


Location: Boston, MA
Remote: Yes

Relocation: For the right opportunity, yes!

Technologies: Most experienced with frontend, however increasingly competent with backend and devops--Git, node, PHP, graphql, mySQL, API work, SSH, Linux, Bash, ansible, vagrant etc. Highly adaptable and enthusiastic about evolving/learning from those around me. While programming and developing for the web are the directions I've been leaning lately, it's likely that my biggest value add from the employer perspective is management/leadership experience, sales/marketing/biz-dev experience, creative problem solving/soft skills/people skills, and a general attitude of "we can get to a solution from here".

I'm a blockchain engineer with 6 years of experience. Been developing software in the space since 2013 when Mt Gox erupted. I have broad experience: built DEXs, p2p networking stacks, smart contract protocols, and other decentralized systems.
Currently looking for a company with a good remote culture and nice people. Doesn't have to be blockchain related. My basic requirement to do my job well is to have access to an automated, deterministic, build system. Unless my job is to do dev ops, I need this to avoid wasting anyones time.

Style of work:

- If I'm a project lead I need to have strategic expectations written down, with those doing the strategy signing off on what I think the project is and how I should go about doing it so the project gets off to a good start.

- If I'm working as an engineer I prefer having responsibility over clearly defined tasks. I've worked best in the past when I've had detailed specs to work with written by another engineer.

Tl: dr; What this comes down to is good developer tooling and clear communication. IMO, you need both to be productive in remote jobs.
